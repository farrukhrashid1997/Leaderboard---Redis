# Leaderboard---Redis

This is a program in python where data structures are used.
The program asks the name and points from players and saves them on the redis server. 
The top 3 players are printed. 
The third player's points are increased which then brings the third one on top.
A sorted set is used for this purpose. 

This is an example of how to use redis with python.
